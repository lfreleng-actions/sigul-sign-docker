# Regression test for the bridge's liveness heartbeat (patch 15).
#
# Every health check the chart ran against the bridge tested state a
# wedged daemon keeps - a live process and a listening socket - so a
# frozen or stuck bridge stayed Ready indefinitely while every request
# hung. Patch 15 gives it a heartbeat file that a publisher thread keeps
# fresh only while the main loop is inside the bound it last declared,
# and the chart's liveness probe reads the file's age.
#
# The checks are behavioural, against the real Heartbeat class and the
# real double_tls hook, and cover both ways the heartbeat can be wrong:
#
# - stale when it should be fresh, which would let liveness kill a
#   healthy bridge - while it waits for a server, or for a peer that has
#   paused mid-request within its declared bound;
# - fresh when it should be stale, which is the defect itself - a main
#   loop that has overrun its bound, still beaten for by the thread.
#
# Timings are scaled down through the module's own constants, so the
# run takes seconds rather than minutes.
#
# Run inside the sigul bridge image:
#   python3 test/test_bridge_heartbeat.py

# pyright: reportUnknownMemberType=false, reportUnknownArgumentType=false
# pyright: reportUnknownVariableType=false, reportAttributeAccessIssue=false
#
# bridge and double_tls are upstream code this repository only patches,
# and ship no type stubs, so their members are untyped by nature.
