The leak detectors, kept apart from the rest of checks.py because

#: Steepest RSS trend tolerated, from a least-squares fit over every
#: sample. A fit is the right detector for a linear leak: it uses the
#: whole run rather than two endpoints, and its units do not change
#: with the profile's length. Set to catch the zombie leak (+50 to
#: +270 MB/h) on runs as short as the PR gate's, where a tighter bound
#: would trip on a few requests' worth of allocation. It deliberately
#: admits slower growth; MAX_SUSTAINED_RSS_SLOPE_MB_PER_HOUR judges
#: that, over spans long enough to measure it.
MAX_RSS_SLOPE_MB_PER_HOUR = 30.0

#: Growth tolerated once a daemon has had hours to reach steady state.
#: A long-lived daemon serving a fixed load should stop growing; this
#: bound catches one that never does, which the bound above admits
#: indefinitely. Found that way: both daemons grow at 7-21 MB/h every
#: nightly, passing the 30 MB/h check while implying the bridge would
#: reach its 512 Mi limit in about a day of sustained load (#32).
#:
#: Over a nightly's four hours the fitted slope's standard error is
#: 0.01-0.1 MB/h, so this is a policy line rather than a noise margin:
#: 5 MB/h is 120 MB a day, material against that limit, and every
#: growth observed so far sits more than twenty standard errors above
#: it.
MAX_SUSTAINED_RSS_SLOPE_MB_PER_HOUR = 5.0

#: Shortest span over which sustained growth is judged. Long enough
#: that warm-up and the heaviest requests no longer steer the fit; the
#: PR gate's half hour is reported but not judged, so this belongs to
#: the nightly.
MIN_SUSTAINED_SPAN_SECONDS = 7200.0

#: Shortest span over which a fitted RSS trend is worth judging. Below
#: this the fit is dominated by a few requests' worth of allocation
#: noise (observed: +10 to +370 MB/h for the same healthy daemon over
#: ninety seconds), so the reading is reported but not judged.
MIN_TREND_SPAN_SECONDS = 600.0

#: Descriptor growth tolerated between the baseline and cooldown phase
#: means. Samples land mid-request, and a request in flight holds
#: around a dozen descriptors on the server, so phase means of a few
#: dozen samples wobble by several either way. The leak this catches
#: was +105 on the bridge in twenty minutes; a fall is never a leak.
MAX_FD_GROWTH = 10
MAX_CLOSE_WAIT_END = 1

#: Samples at the end of cooldown that a zombie must appear in, every
#: one of them, to count as left behind: twelve, a minute at the
#: sampler's interval. The cooldown is still under load, and since
#: patch 19 the server waits for its request child a second at a time,
#: reaping orphans between slices - so the gpg helpers a signing
#: request orphans stay zombies for up to a second, and about a third
#: of samples catch up to a dozen on their way out. Across every
#: nightly since, no more than five samples in a row held one. A
#: zombie that nobody will reap is in every sample from the moment it
#: appears, so the fewest seen over the window is what was left
#: behind, and a transient cannot reach it however unluckily the
#: samples fall.
