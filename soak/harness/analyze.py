"""Turn the run's CSVs into a verdict.

Three inputs, all written independently during the run and joined
here on wall-clock time:

- `requests.csv`  every sigul invocation: when, what, how long, outcome
- `samples.csv`   the daemons' memory, descriptors and socket states
- `timeline.csv`  phases and fault windows

Two kinds of judgement come out:

Invariants are absolute. The service must recover after every fault
within a bound; descriptors and CLOSE-WAIT sockets must return to where
they started; nothing may be left as a zombie. Breaking one of these is
a defect regardless of what any previous run did.

Regressions are relative to a committed baseline: latency percentiles,
memory trend, success rate. They catch slow decay that no single
absolute threshold would.

A fault or invariant may be marked in `expectations.json` as expected
to fail, with the issue that tracks it. Such a check failing is
reported as XFAIL and does not fail the run; such a check *passing* is
reported as XPASS and does fail it, because the marker is now stale
and someone should remove it and close the issue.

Rendering (markdown, charts) lives in `report.py`.
