"""Process-level faults: the daemons themselves misbehave or vanish.

Restarts are what a crash loop, an OOM kill or a chart rollout look
like from the other side of the connection. Freezes are subtler and
more dangerous: every socket stays open, nothing is refused, and the
peer has no signal at all that anything is wrong. That is the shape
of the production wedge, and it is why the liveness probe now checks
for an established connection rather than a live process.
