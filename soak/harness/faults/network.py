"""Network conditions, applied through Toxiproxy.

Two proxies stand in front of the bridge: one on the client port, one
on the server port. Every fault here is a toxic on one of them, so the
stack's own configuration is untouched and each condition can be
switched on and off in the middle of a run.

The server-link faults are the ones with production history. The
server holds a single idle connection to the bridge for as long as it
takes the next request to arrive; anything on that path that drops
state silently - NAT tables, load-balancer idle timeouts, a rebooted
firewall - produces a connection that both ends believe is open and
neither can use.
