# Remove pip from a finished image, then prove nothing of it remains.
#
# pip is a build-time tool here: it installs python-nss-ng (all images)
# and SQLAlchemy/passlib (bridge, server). No RPM requires python3-pip
# and no Sigul component imports it, so the published images do not
# need it.
#
# Shipping it is not harmless. pip vendors its own urllib3, msgpack and
# setuptools under pip/_vendor/, and upgrading pip cannot fix them:
# Fedora 44's python3-pip vendors urllib3 1.26.20 and the newest pip on
# PyPI vendors 2.7.0, both affected by CVE-2026-97689 /
# GHSA-vxq7-64xx-v4gw (fixed in urllib3 2.8.0). Those copies carry no
# dist-info, so the SBOM omits them and the Grype gate cannot see them.
#
# Two installs exist: the /usr/local copy from the pip self-upgrade, and
# the dnf python3-pip package beneath it. Both go. The checks then fail
# the build if pip is still importable, still on PATH, or has left a
# vendored tree behind.
#
# Fedora's python-pip-wheel stays: python3-libs requires it for
# ensurepip. It is a wheel archive under /usr/share/python-wheels, never
# on sys.path, and is unpacked only when something creates a venv.
