# Sigul Server Entrypoint
#
# This script provides the entrypoint for the Sigul server container.
# It validates prerequisites and starts the server process with proper logging.
#
# Logging Configuration:
#   All server processes are started with -vv (DEBUG level) for maximum visibility.
#   This ensures logs are available in both console (docker logs) and file (/var/log/sigul_server.log).
#   For production, consider changing to -v (INFO level) to reduce log volume.
#
# Process Management:
#   - Normal mode: Uses 'exec' to replace entrypoint with server process (PID 1)
#   - Debug mode: Forks server and monitors it (set DEBUG_MODE=1)
#
# Key Design Principles:
# - Minimal wrapper logic
# - Direct service invocation with full logging
# - Fast startup with essential validation
# - Clear, actionable error messages
# - Wait for bridge availability before starting

# Bridge Availability Check
#######################################

# Wait until the bridge's hostname resolves.
#
# Deliberately DNS-only. The obvious check - opening a TCP connection
# to the bridge's port - is the one thing that must not happen here:
# the bridge accepts one connection at a time and immediately tries to
# complete a TLS handshake on it, so a probe that connects and hangs up
# is accepted, fails its handshake against a peer that has already
# gone, and is logged as an error with a traceback. It also consumes an
# accept slot that exists to serve signing requests, and if it arrives
# while the bridge is busy it waits in the listen backlog and produces
# that error later, at a moment unrelated to any startup.
#
# Nothing is lost by not connecting. Ordering is already guaranteed
# either side of this: under Compose by `depends_on: service_healthy`
# against a healthcheck that only reads `ss -tln`, and under the chart
# by the wait-for-bridge initContainer, which resolves the *headless*
# Service - whose DNS records exist only while the bridge pod is Ready
# - for exactly these reasons. This check resolves bridge-hostname,
# which under the chart is the ordinary ClusterIP Service and resolves
# whether or not the bridge is Ready, so it is not a readiness gate and
# is not trying to be one. The daemon itself retries a refused
# connection with backoff, so a server that starts first recovers on
# its own. What this does catch is a misconfigured bridge-hostname,
# turning it into a clear message here rather than a reconnect loop
# later.

# Carry state from where earlier releases kept it onto the data volume.

# Until the server's database and GnuPG home were configured under
# $SERVER_DATA_DIR, the volume, they lived in $DATA_DIR on the
# container's writable layer. That layer survives a container restart,
# but not a recreation, so this is the only chance to keep a stack's
# users and signing keys: the first start after the configuration
# moved. Each is moved only if the volume has nothing of its own there,
# so state already on the volume always wins.
# Point server.conf's storage at the data volume, where it still names
# the old places. Releases before the move wrote database-path as
# $DATA_DIR/server.sqlite and no gnupg-home, which Sigul defaults to
# $DATA_DIR/gnupg: both on the writable layer. Under Compose that
# config lives on a volume and is rewritten only with new certificates,
# so an upgraded server kept those paths and started on an empty
# database beside the state preserved for it. Only those two settings
# change, and only from those values; everything else - the NSS
# password with it - is left as it is. The chart renders server.conf
# afresh with the new paths, so there it finds nothing to do.
#
# Where it must change and cannot, the server does not start. Its
# state is on the volume by now - the deploy moved it there, or the
# move below would - so starting with the old paths would serve an
# empty database while looking healthy.
