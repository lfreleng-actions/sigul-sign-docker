# Sigul Patches

This directory contains patches that fix critical issues in upstream Sigul v1.4
to enable proper operation in containerized environments.

## Purpose

These patches are automatically applied during the Docker image build process
to fix issues that prevent Sigul from working in containers. The
patches remain minimal and focused on critical functionality.

## Patches

### 01-fix-double-tls-handshake-timing.patch

**Status:** CRITICAL - Required for functionality
**Upstream Status:** Local fork (upstream Sigul is unmaintained; see below)
**Affects:** Bridge component

**Problem:**
The upstream Sigul bridge accepts the server's TCP connection but delays the
TLS handshake until a client connects. In containerized environments with
variable connection timing, this causes the server-side TLS handshake to
timeout, resulting in `PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR` / "Unexpected EOF in NSPR" errors.

**Fix:**
Completes the server TLS handshake right after accepting the TCP
connection, before waiting for client connections. This ensures stable
double-TLS communication.

**Impact:**

- Without this patch: All Sigul operations fail with I/O errors
- With this patch: Stable, reliable double-TLS communication

**Code Changes:**

- Adds `server_sock.force_handshake()` right after server accept
- Adds server certificate validation
- Adds error handling for handshake failures

### 02-verbose-auth-logging.patch

**Status:** Optional - controlled by `SIGUL_DEBUG_AUTH` env var
**Upstream Status:** Local fork (upstream Sigul is unmaintained; see below)
**Affects:** Bridge and server

**Problem:**
Upstream Sigul is intentionally tight-lipped about authentication
failures (to avoid timing/oracle leaks).  In a containerised
stack that produces silent end-to-end failures with no
daemon-side trace to root-cause from.

**Fix:**
Adds a small `_adbg()` helper and call sites at every auth
checkpoint on the bridge and server.  The `SIGUL_DEBUG_AUTH`
environment variable controls output; when unset, behaviour is
bit-for-bit identical to upstream.

**Impact:**

- With `SIGUL_DEBUG_AUTH=1`: every auth checkpoint emits a
  human-readable `AUTHDBG/*` log line (peer cert CN, declared
  user, password-field presence, sha512_password lookup result,
  crypt(3) compare result).  Log lines carry metadata - no
  secret values are ever printed.
- With `SIGUL_DEBUG_AUTH` unset (the default): no logging,
  no per-request peer-cert lookup, no extra `crypt(3)` calls.

**Code Changes:**

- `bridge.py`: log server/client TCP accepts and post-handshake
  peer cert CN.
- `server.py`: log handler dispatch, request fields, and the
  per-step result of `authenticate_admin`'s password compare.
- Renames a shadowed local variable (`user` -> `user_row`) in
  `authenticate_admin` so the log lines are unambiguous.

### 03-fix-delete-key-gpg-home-cleanup.patch

**Status:** CRITICAL - Required for `sigul delete-key` /
`sigul import-key` round-trip to work.
**Upstream Status:** Local fork (upstream Sigul is unmaintained; see below)
**Affects:** Server

**Problem:**
`server_gpg.Context.delete()` uses the legacy
`op_delete(key, allow_secret_bool)` API.  In `python-gpg >= 1.23`
that call is a silent no-op: gpgme deprecated `gpgme_op_delete`,
the python wrapper does not raise, and the secret/public key
material stays in the gnupg-home.

Result: `sigul delete-key` removes the row from the server's
sqlite DB (so `sigul list-keys` no longer reports the key) but
leaves the underlying GPG key material in place.  A follow-up
`sigul import-key` for the same fingerprint fails with
`Error: Invalid import file: Unexpected import file contents`
because gpg reports the key as already-imported.

**Fix:**
Switch to `op_delete_ext(key, mode_flags)` with
`DELETE_ALLOW_SECRET | DELETE_FORCE` flags, the modern API that
actually deletes.

**Impact:**

- Without this patch: `delete-key` is a half-fix that breaks
  every later `import-key` for the same fingerprint, and
  `scripts/run-signing-tests.sh` requires a Phase 0 reset that
  `rm -rf`'s the server gnupg-home before each run.
- With this patch: `delete-key` removes the GPG material as
  expected.  The Phase 0 reset becomes a no-op on a clean stack;
  a follow-up commit can remove it entirely.

### 04-fix-optional-fedora-client-guard.patch

**Status:** CRITICAL on Fedora 44+ - bridge will not start without it
**Upstream Status:** Local fork (upstream Sigul is unmaintained; see below)
**Affects:** Bridge

**Problem:**
`bridge.py` imports `fedora.client` (provided by the
`python3-fedora` package, used only for FAS authentication)
behind a `try/except ImportError` and sets `have_fas` accordingly.
Later, however, the privilege-drop block accesses
`fedora.client.baseclient.SESSION_DIR` *unconditionally*.
When the package is absent the unconditional access raises
`NameError: name 'fedora' is not defined`, the surrounding
exception handler logs a misleading
`Error switching to user 1000: name 'fedora' is not defined`,
and the bridge daemon exits before serving any request.

The `python3-fedora` package was retired between Fedora 41 and
Fedora 44; on F44 base images the bridge therefore fails to
start out-of-the-box.

**Fix:**
Guards the FAS session-dir initialisation with `if have_fas:`,
matching the `try/except` import guard at the top of the module.
When FAS is unavailable the bridge skips the FAS-only setup and
continues normal startup.

**Impact:**

- Without this patch on F44+: bridge crashes at startup; nothing
  works.
- With this patch: bridge runs normally with or without
  `python3-fedora` installed.  We do not use FAS authentication,
  so the only effect is that `python3-fedora` is no longer a
  hard dependency of the bridge image.

### 05-fix-optional-rpm-head-signing.patch

**Status:** CRITICAL on Fedora 44+ - server will not start without it
**Upstream Status:** Local fork (upstream Sigul is unmaintained; see below)
**Affects:** Server

**Problem:**
`server.py` imports `rpm_head_signing` at module top level.
On Fedora 44 the stock `rpm-head-signing-1.7.4-12.fc44` package
was last rebuilt against the older RPM 4.x ABI and references
`rpmWriteSignature`, a symbol that RPM 6.0.1 (the librpm
shipped on Fedora 44) no longer exports.  The C-extension
therefore fails to load with:

```text
ImportError: insertlib.cpython-314-aarch64-linux-gnu.so:
    undefined symbol: rpmWriteSignature
```

Because the import is at module top level, the whole server
crashes on startup before any client request can be handled.

`rpm_head_signing` is used solely by the optional
`sign-rpms --head-signing` code path.  Standard `sign-rpm` and
`sign-rpms` (without `--head-signing`) do not need it.

**Fix:**
Makes the `rpm_head_signing` imports tolerant of
`ImportError`, captures the failure reason, and raises a
helpful `RPMFileError` later, but solely on actual head-signing
requests.  The error message points operators at the
F44 ABI mismatch and tells them to either rebuild
`rpm-head-signing` against the new librpm or use the standard
(non-head-signing) code path.

**Impact:**

- Without this patch on F44+: server crashes at startup;
  nothing works.
- With this patch: server starts cleanly on a stock F44 host;
  all standard signing operations (those that our test suite
  exercises) work.  `--head-signing` remains unavailable on F44
  until the upstream `rpm-head-signing` package gains support
  for the RPM 6 ABI.

### 06-fix-double-tls-teardown-deadlock.patch

**Status:** CRITICAL - without it the server stops serving after a
connection is torn down, while still appearing healthy
**Upstream Status:** Local fork (upstream Sigul is unmaintained; see below)
**Affects:** Server (and any `DoubleTLSClient` user)

**Problem:**
Teardown of a double-TLS connection waits on the peer without any
bound, in two places:

- `_ForwardingBuffer.forward_two_way()` polls with
  `PR_INTERVAL_NO_TIMEOUT`, and `_SplittingBuffer._active` stays true
  until the peer's socket reports EOF.
- `DoubleTLSClient.outer_close()` then calls `os.waitpid(pid, 0)` on
  the forwarding child, also unbounded.

A peer that receives our `FIN` but never sends its own therefore pins
three processes: the forwarding child in `poll()`, the connection owner
in `waitpid()`, and the daemon's main loop in `waitpid()` on that. The
main loop never forks a replacement child, so nothing reconnects to the
bridge and every later request fails with `Unexpected EOF in NSPR`.

Observed in production: the server sat in exactly this state for six
hours after serving one request. The socket to the bridge was in
`FIN-WAIT-2`, the bridge held the other half in `CLOSE-WAIT`, and
`/proc/*/wchan` showed `do_wait`, `do_wait`, `poll_schedule_timeout`.
The process was still present, so a process-existence liveness check
kept passing throughout.

Upstream's own backstop does not cover this. The
`signal.alarm(CHILD_TIMEOUT_SECS)` set in `server.py` is what starts
the teardown in the first place (see the trigger note below), and once
the child is blocked in `waitpid()` nothing else fires: `SigPnd: 0`
after six hours simply means the one-shot alarm had already been
delivered and consumed.

**Fix:**
Bound both waits, and only during teardown of the forwarding child:

- `forward_two_way()` gains an optional `shutdown_linger`. Only
  `DoubleTLSClient.__child()` passes it: there `buf_1` going inactive
  means the pipes are gone and our shutdown has been forwarded, so the
  loop switches to a one-second poll tick and gives the peer
  `_SHUTDOWN_LINGER_SECONDS` (five) to close before abandoning the
  connection. While the local side is still open it blocks
  indefinitely as before, so an idle daemon still waits hours for the
  next request. The linger is short because nothing of value can
  arrive once the local side is gone; it exists so a healthy close
  stays clean.
- The bridge's `bridge_inner_stream()` shares the primitive but does
  not pass a linger. There `buf_1` inactive means only that the client
  has finished its half of the inner session while the server's half
  is still in flight; a linger applied there would abandon live
  requests.
- `outer_close()` reaps through `WNOHANG` up to
  `_CHILD_EXIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (ten), then `SIGKILL`s the forwarding
  child. This bound exceeds the linger plus a tick on purpose: the
  child's own linger is the graceful path, and the kill is the
  fallback for a child stuck somewhere other than the poll loop. The
  child holds no state worth preserving either way.

Preserving the unbounded idle case is the constraint that shapes this
patch: a blanket timeout would be a worse bug than the one it fixes.

**Test:** `test/test_double_tls_teardown.py`, which drives the real
code with a peer that never closes. Against unpatched sigul the first
check reports `STILL BLOCKED`; against patched it returns at the linger
bound, while the idle check confirms indefinite waiting still works
and a bridge-shaped call without a linger keeps waiting too. A further
check forks a real forwarding child and closes it through the real
`outer_close()`, asserting the child exits on its own before the kill
fires; a source check pins that `__child()` is the one caller passing
the linger.

`scripts/run-lifecycle-tests.sh` phase 4 then reproduces the
production deadlock on the live stack: it freezes the bridge so it
cannot close, and fires the server child's hourly alarm early. Against
v2.2.4 the child is still wedged in `waitpid()` thirty seconds later
and the next request fails with `Unexpected EOF in NSPR`; against the
patched images it abandons the connection within the linger, a
replacement connects, and the next request succeeds.

**Trigger, for the record:** `server.py` arms `signal.alarm(3600)` in
every forked child at fork time, whether or not a request ever
arrives. An idle child therefore tears its connection down after an
hour. With an unpatched bridge that teardown is never answered (see
07), and with an unpatched server it never completes. Production
served one request and then wedged while idle, which this explains
without any network fault.

### 07-fix-bridge-server-socket-lifecycle.patch

**Status:** CRITICAL - without it the bridge leaks a socket per failed
server handshake and hands dead server connections to clients
**Upstream Status:** Local fork (upstream Sigul is unmaintained; see below)
**Affects:** Bridge

**Problem:**
`bridge_one_request()` accepts one server connection, then blocks in a
bare `client_listen_sock.accept()` until a client arrives. Two defects
follow from that shape:

- The server socket is closed only inside the client-wait block. A
  server that fails its outer TLS handshake, or presents no
  certificate, is accepted, rejected and then never closed. Each such
  attempt leaks one socket, left in `CLOSE-WAIT` with the peer's final
  bytes unread, for the life of the bridge process. Anything that can
  reach the server port - a scanner, a misconfigured peer, a
  crash-looping server - can grow this without bound.
- While waiting for a client the bridge has no knowledge of the server
  socket. A server that dies during that wait, which in production can
  last hours, is only discovered when a client finally connects and is
  paired with the corpse; that client fails with `Unexpected EOF`. The
  server's `FIN` also sits unread, so the bridge never closes its half.
  This is the other side of patch 06: an unpatched server's teardown
  waits forever on exactly that missing close.

Observed in production: the bridge held three `CLOSE-WAIT` sockets on
the server port, one with 98 unread bytes, alongside
`Unexpected EOF on outer stream` and `_InnerBridgingBuffer: data
dropped` in its log, while the server sat in the patch 06 deadlock.

**Fix:**

- Replace the bare `accept()` with `_wait_for_client_or_server_loss()`,
  an NSPR poll on both `client_listen_sock` and `server_sock`. A server
  that has completed its handshake sends nothing until a client
  arrives, so any readiness on its socket means it has closed or
  failed. The bridge logs, discards it and returns to waiting for a
  fresh server instead of pairing the next client with a dead one.
- Close both sockets in a `finally` that covers every exit path of
  `bridge_one_request()`, including the handshake and certificate
  failures the old structure skipped.

The poll stays unbounded: the bridge must still wait indefinitely for
the next client, exactly as before. Only what it notices while waiting
changes.

**Test:** `scripts/run-lifecycle-tests.sh`, run against the compose
stack after the signing tests. It asserts on socket and process
tables, not log text: five bogus TLS handshakes on the server port
must leave no new `CLOSE-WAIT` sockets, and a server restart while the
bridge waits for a client must leave none either, with the first
request after the restart succeeding. Against unpatched sigul the
handshake phase leaks one socket per attempt.

### 08-fix-server-reap-orphaned-children.patch

**Status:** CRITICAL - without it the server accumulates one zombie
process per gpg helper it spawns, until the container's pid limit
stops it forking at all
**Upstream Status:** Local fork (upstream Sigul is unmaintained; see below)
**Affects:** Server

**Problem:**
The server's main loop forks one child per connection and waits for
it with `os.waitpid(child_pid, 0)` - that child, and only that child.
In a container the server is PID 1, so every process orphaned anywhere
beneath it is reparented to it, and nothing else will ever wait for
those. The gpg helpers spawned while signing are orphaned that way by
design: gpgme double-forks so that it need not wait for them. Each one
therefore stays a zombie for the life of the daemon.

Measured by the soak harness: roughly ten zombies per signing request
(`gpg`, `gpgconf`, and a `python3` per request), 7,423 after
twenty-eight minutes of load. The local Kubernetes pod reports
`pids.max` of 11,965; at that point `fork()` fails and the server
stops serving until the pod is restarted. Each zombie also holds
around 7 KB of kernel memory, which shows as steady RSS growth.
Control-plane requests (`list-users`, `list-keys`) do not spawn gpg
and leave nothing behind.

**Fix:**
Replace the targeted wait with a loop over `os.waitpid(-1, 0)` that
reaps whatever exits until the request child itself is returned. The
main loop is blocked in that wait for the whole life of each child,
so orphans are reaped as they die rather than accumulating. Only the
request child's status is inspected; the others are logged at debug
level.

This only helps when the server is PID 1. Under the Helm chart it is.
Under Compose `scripts/entrypoint-server.sh` used `su`, which stayed
resident as the daemon's parent and reaped nothing; it now drops
privileges with `setpriv` so the daemon is PID 1 there too, matching
the chart. The environment is passed through as `su` passed it, with
`HOME`, `USER`, `LOGNAME` and `SHELL` set from the passwd entry.

**Test:** the soak harness's `sigul-server: no zombie processes` and
`RSS trend` invariants, previously marked expected-fail against
issue #14.

### 09-fix-bridge-handshake-deadline.patch

**Status:** CRITICAL - without it one silent connection stops all
signing for as long as it stays open
**Upstream Status:** Local fork (upstream Sigul is unmaintained; see below)
**Affects:** Bridge

**Problem:**
The bridge accepts a peer and calls `force_handshake()` on it with no
deadline. It serves one client at a time, so a peer that connects and
then sends nothing holds the only slot there is until it goes away: a
port scanner, a load balancer or health check that opens a bare TCP
connection, a client suspended between `connect()` and its
ClientHello, or a NAT that drops the client's packets after the SYN.
The same applies on the server port while the bridge waits for a
server. NSPR sockets do not honour `socket.setdefaulttimeout()`, so
the daemon's one-hour default gave no protection either.

Measured by the soak harness: two silent connections to the client
port, **0 requests served in 60 s**; service resumed only when they
closed.

**Fix:**
Both handshakes go through `_handshake_with_deadline()`, a wall-clock
bound of five seconds on the whole handshake. NSS's own
`force_handshake_timeout()` is not enough: it limits each individual
read, so a peer trickling one byte a second passes it indefinitely -
measured, an honest request behind such a peer was still waiting at
sixty seconds. Instead the socket is switched to non-blocking, the
handshake is driven a step at a time, and between steps the socket is
polled with the remaining time; blocking mode is restored on every
path. A real Sigul peer completes the handshake in well under a second
even across a WAN, and the clock starts at `accept()`, so time queued
in the listen backlog does not count. On expiry the bridge raises
`PR_IO_TIMEOUT_ERROR`, logs a plain `Peer stopped responding ...;
dropping it` warning naming both this deadline and patch 11's, and,
through the patch 07 cleanup, closes the
peer and returns to its accept loop. When
the dropped peer was a client, the paired server connection is closed
with it and the server reconnects within a second, as for any other
rejected client.

**Test:** with two silent connections parked on the client port, an
honest `list-users` is now served after nine seconds (two deadlines)
rather than never; behind a one-byte-a-second slow-loris it is served
after two; a silent connection parked on the server port delays a
restarted server's pairing by one deadline rather than forever. The
soak harness's `client_connect_and_hang` fault, previously marked
expected-fail against issue #11, passes.

### 10-fix-bridge-listen-backlog.patch

**Status:** IMPORTANT - without it a burst of concurrent clients is
partly refused, and the `sigul` CLI does not retry
**Upstream Status:** Local fork (upstream Sigul is unmaintained; see below)
**Affects:** Bridge

**Problem:**
`create_listen_sock()` calls `listen()` with the python-nss default
backlog of five. The bridge accepts one connection at a time, and
only between requests, so everything that arrives while it is busy
waits in that queue. Six CI jobs signing together overflow it: the
kernel drops the excess SYNs, the clients' kernels retry with
exponential backoff, and after a few retries `connect()` fails
outright with nothing to tell the client it was merely early.

Measured: twelve concurrent `list-users` clients against the default
produced seven `TcpExtListenDrops`; the clients survived only because
the kernel's SYN retries happened to fit inside the CLI's timeout.

**Fix:**
`listen(128)` on both listening sockets. Nothing about the workload
changes - the bridge still serves one client at a time - except that
a burst waits its turn instead of being turned away. Twelve and thirty
concurrent clients against the patched bridge: zero drops, all served,
in six and eight seconds respectively.

A large backlog does mean that connections which will never complete
a handshake now queue rather than being dropped. With patch 09 alone
each cost one handshake deadline when its turn came - the soak
harness's `client_backlog_flood` fault measured twenty of them
stalling an honest client for twenty deadlines. Patch 13 takes
handshakes off the accept loop's critical path, and that fault now
passes.

### 11-fix-bridge-request-idle-deadline.patch

**Status:** CRITICAL - without it a client that goes silent
mid-request holds the bridge's single slot for as long as it likes
**Upstream Status:** Local fork (upstream Sigul is unmaintained; see below)
**Affects:** Bridge (and `double_tls.OuterBuffer` /
`forward_two_way`, which gain optional deadlines the server and client
do not use)

**Problem:**
Once a client has completed its handshake and the bridge is relaying
its request, every read and write on either peer blocks with no
deadline: `OuterBuffer` for the headers and payloads, `forward_two_way`
for the inner stream. A client suspended mid-upload, a CI runner
paused by its scheduler, or a peer behind a NAT that has dropped the
flow all look exactly like a slow peer. The bridge serves one client
at a time, so everyone else waits until the frozen client is killed -
the soak harness measured a real `sign-data` frozen at 6 MB into a
384 MB upload blocking all signing for the whole window. The server's
one-hour alarm was the only bound.

**Fix:**
`OuterBuffer` takes an optional `idle_timeout`, applied to each receive
and send; `forward_two_way` takes one too and raises
`IdleTimeoutError` when a full period passes with no event on any
descriptor. Only the bridge passes them, at 120 seconds: a peer that
moves no bytes at all for two minutes mid-request has stopped. On
expiry the bridge logs the drop plainly and, through the patch 07
cleanup, closes both peers and returns to its accept loop; the server
reconnects within a second. No legitimate Sigul operation goes two
minutes without a byte crossing the bridge - the largest signing
operations either stream or finish in seconds - and the full signing
suite passes unchanged against the patched bridge.

The server and client code paths are untouched: the defaults keep
their previous unbounded behaviour.

As shipped, only the `OuterBuffer` half of this worked: the
`forward_two_way` deadline was reset by phantom events on every
timeout and never fired. Patch 12 fixes the poll results it relies on.

**Test:** a real client frozen 6 MB into an upload; an honest
`list-users` retried every thirty seconds is refused four times and
served at 122 seconds, where before it was never served. The soak
harness's `client_handshake_then_hang` and `client_stop_mid_sign`
faults now recover within the window.

### 12-fix-nspr-poll-timeout-flags.patch

**Status:** CRITICAL - without it every timed poll in `double_tls`
sees phantom events, and the patch 11 inner-stream deadline never fires
**Upstream Status:** Local fork (upstream Sigul is unmaintained; see below)
**Affects:** `double_tls` (used by bridge, server and client)

**Problem:**
`nss.io.Socket.poll()` returns `PR_Poll()`'s `out_flags` without
looking at its return value, and NSPR only fills those in when at
least one descriptor is ready. When the call times out instead, each
`out_flags` still holds the scratch bits NSPR wrote while translating
the request for the system `poll()`: `0x1` for a READ interest and
`0x8` for a WRITE interest - which read back as `PR_POLL_READ` and
`PR_POLL_ERR`. So after a timeout every descriptor looks readable, and
every one we wanted to write looks failed.

Upstream Sigul never noticed because it never polled with a timeout:
every call passed `PR_INTERVAL_NO_TIMEOUT`. Patches 06 and 11
introduced timed polls, and the effects were: the `forward_two_way`
idle deadline was reset on every timeout ("something happened") and
never fired, so a client frozen during the inner-TLS phase still held
the bridge's slot; and a buffer with data queued for a destination
that was merely full saw `PR_POLL_ERR` and dropped the data. Measured
in the bridge image: two idle sockets bridged with `idle_timeout=2`,
no `IdleTimeoutError` in 6 seconds; polling an idle socket for WRITE
with a full send buffer returned `[1, 8]`.

**Fix:**
A new `double_tls.poll_sockets()` wraps `nss.io.Socket.poll()` with a
sentinel: one end of an idle loopback pair, polled for READ alongside
the real descriptors. It has nothing to read, so it reports readable
only when the whole call timed out and the scratch bits were never
overwritten; in that case every result is forced to `0`. `_nspr_poll`
uses it, so `forward_two_way` and everything built on it are
corrected without further change; patch 13's admission loop uses it
directly. One sentinel pair per process, recreated after `fork()`.

**Test:** `test/test_nspr_poll_timeout.py`, run in the bridge image in
CI. Against the unpatched module it reports `[1, 1]` and `[1, 8]` for
idle READ and blocked WRITE interests and the idle deadline never
fires; patched, `[0, 0]`, real events still reported unchanged, the
deadline fires at 2.0 s idle and 5.0 s when fed traffic for the first
3 s.

### 13-fix-bridge-concurrent-client-admission.patch

**Status:** CRITICAL - without it a burst of connections that never
speak stalls honest clients for one handshake deadline each
**Upstream Status:** Local fork (upstream Sigul is unmaintained; see below)
**Affects:** Bridge

**Problem:**
The bridge pairs one client with one server at a time, and before
this patch it also *accepted* clients one at a time: `accept()`, then
the whole TLS handshake, on the accept loop's critical path. Patch 09
bounded each handshake at five seconds, and patch 10 let a burst of
connections queue instead of being SYN-dropped, but together they
meant twenty connections that never send a ClientHello - a port scan,
load-balancer health checks, clients suspended between `connect()` and
their hello - cost an honest client behind them twenty deadlines: a
hundred seconds. Every rejected client also cost a server reconnect,
because the server connection was closed with it. The soak harness's
`client_backlog_flood` fault measured exactly this and was marked
expected-fail against issue #13.

**Fix:**
A `ClientAdmission` object owns the client listening socket for the
life of the daemon. While the bridge is waiting for a client it polls
the server socket, the listening socket and every pending client
together (through patch 12's `poll_sockets()`), accepts everything
queued, drives each pending handshake one non-blocking step whenever
its socket is readable, and returns the first to complete - in
blocking mode, as everything downstream expects. Peers that fail
their handshake are logged and dropped without ending the wait, so
the server connection is never touched by a client that was never
going to be served. Silent peers are shed at the deadline, which is
charged only for time the bridge spends attending to them: a client
accepted just as another wins the slot is not charged for the request
it then waits behind, so a busy bridge does not drop honest clients.
The pending set is capped at 256; beyond that the bridge stops
accepting until it drains and arrivals wait in the kernel backlog as
before. The server-side handshake is unchanged.

The bridge remains single-threaded and still serves one request at a
time. Only admission is concurrent.

**Test:** with twenty silent connections parked on the client port, an
honest `list-users` is served in 0.67 s (previously ~100 s); all
twenty are dropped together at the deadline. Thirty concurrent honest
clients under continuous slow-loris, garbage, RST and half-close
pressure: 30/30 served in 16 s, zero server reconnects, zero leaked
descriptors after 1,500 rejected peers. `test/test_bridge_client_admission.py`,
run in the bridge image in CI, drives the class directly against a
real TLS listener. The soak harness's `client_backlog_flood` fault
passes and its expected-fail marker is removed.

### 14-fix-bridge-quiet-peer-disconnect.patch

**Status:** COSMETIC - the bridge behaves correctly either way; this
is about what its log tells whoever reads it
**Upstream Status:** Local fork (upstream Sigul is unmaintained; see below)
**Affects:** Bridge

**Problem:**
A peer that connects to the server port and hangs up without speaking
was logged as `ERROR: Server TLS handshake failed`, re-raised, and
logged a second time by the generic NSPR handler with a full
traceback. Health checks, port scanners and load balancers do exactly
this, so every start of the stack put a red error and a stack trace at
the top of the bridge log - the first thing anyone reads during an
incident, and unrelated to any incident. Seen on every Compose deploy
and on the OpenSearch production deployment.

The immediate source was the server's own entrypoint, which probed the
bridge with `nc -z` before starting the daemon; that is fixed
separately, outside the patch series. But the bridge is internet-facing
on its client port and will always meet peers that connect and leave,
so it should not call that a failure of its own.

**Fix:**
`PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR` and `PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR` during the
server-side handshake are reported as `INFO: Server went away during
its TLS handshake; waiting for it to reconnect`, and the request is
abandoned without an exception, so no traceback is produced. The
bridge returns to its accept loop exactly as before - only the log
changes. Every other failure keeps exactly the handling it already
had: a protocol violation is still logged at `ERROR` and re-raised,
which produces the traceback from the handler above, while a
handshake that runs out of time (patch 09) or a peer whose
certificate has expired are reported as plain warnings, deliberately
and unchanged by this patch.

This matches what the client side already does through patch 13's
`ClientAdmission`, which reports the same event as `INFO: Client
<addr> went away during its TLS handshake`. The two sides now describe
the same thing the same way.

**Test:** a clean deploy reaches `Server authenticated` with zero
`ERROR` or `Traceback` lines in the bridge log, where before it always
carried one of each. With the server stopped, `nc -z` against the
server port produces one `INFO` line and no traceback, and the bridge
pairs normally when the server returns. The full signing suite passes
unchanged (41/41).

### 15-fix-bridge-liveness-heartbeat.patch

**Status:** CRITICAL - without it a wedged bridge is never detected
**Upstream Status:** Local fork (upstream Sigul is unmaintained; see below)
**Affects:** Bridge; the chart's bridge probes depend on it

**Problem:**
Nothing could tell a wedged bridge from a healthy one. Every health
check the chart ran - startup, readiness, liveness, and the sidecar's
`/healthz` behind the NLB - tested a live process or a listening
socket, and a frozen or stuck daemon keeps both. Frozen on a kind
cluster, the bridge stayed `Ready` with no restarts for as long as it
stayed frozen, the NLB kept routing to it, and every request hung: a
total signing outage reported as healthy, with nothing that would ever
recover it (#33).

State cannot answer the question; only progress can. But the obvious
heartbeat - touch a file from the main loop - would have been worse
than none. The main loop blocks legitimately, for long periods: it
waited for the server with no timeout at all, waited for a client with
none when nothing was pending, and patch 11 lets a single receive or
send run for 120 s. A heartbeat beaten only between those would have
let liveness kill a healthy bridge whenever its server restarted - so
that a restart of one daemon cascaded into a restart of the other - or
whenever a client paused mid-request.

**Fix:**
The main loop reports progress on every wakeup of every wait, naming
the longest that wait may now legitimately block. A publisher thread
rewrites `/run/sigul_bridge.heartbeat` every five seconds, but only
while the main loop is inside its own declared bound plus five seconds'
slack. The heartbeat therefore goes stale when:

- the whole process is frozen, since the thread is part of it; or
- the main loop overruns its bound - stuck in a syscall, deadlocked,
  or looping without waiting - with the thread still running, which a
  heartbeat beaten unconditionally from a thread would never notice.

The publisher logs `Main loop overdue; heartbeat withheld` once, then
once a minute, rather than on every missed beat.

The two waits that could block forever are bounded: the server accept
and the idle client wait now come round every ten seconds, so an idle
bridge with no server still beats. The request relay (`double_tls`)
reports through a `progress_hook` that is `None` by default, so the
server and client, which share that module, are unaffected. The
request handlers' own phases - where RPM signing talks to Koji - hold
a thirty-minute *lease*, since those calls report nothing; generous
for a large batch, finite so that a call that never returns is
caught. A lease exists because reporting alone is last-writer-wins: a
phase that allowed thirty minutes and then did a routine 120 s read
would otherwise have its allowance cut to 120 s, and a slow Koji call
after the read would restart a healthy bridge. The batch handler runs
I/O and Koji in worker threads at the same time, where no single
deadline could be right. Reports inside a lease may extend the
deadline but never shorten it, and the lease ends with its block
however the block ends.

The heartbeat is removed at startup: `/run` is an `emptyDir` that
outlives a container restart, and a predecessor's heartbeat would
otherwise be read as the new daemon's.

The chart change that uses it is outside the patch series: liveness
fails once the heartbeat is more than 30 s old (six missed beats) on
three checks ten seconds apart; readiness requires it fresh as well as
the port listening; and `/healthz`, which the NLB checks, reports it
too, so a wedged bridge stops receiving outside traffic. The sidecar's
own probes move to a new `/alive`, because probing it with `/healthz`
would restart the healthy sidecar whenever the bridge wedged.

**Test:** on kind, with the bridge frozen from its node: readiness
fails at 52 s and liveness replaces it at 88 s, where before it was
never replaced; the sidecar is not restarted, and the next request
succeeds in 1 s. The soak's `proc_wedge_bridge` fault moves from XFAIL
to XPASS. With no server connected for 90 s, and with a real client
frozen mid-upload for 150 s - past the 120 s idle deadline, which the
bridge then enforces itself - the heartbeat stays under 5 s old and
the bridge is not restarted. A main loop that declares a 10 s wait and
hangs is withheld 15 s later. The Compose `pr` soak passes: 11/11
faults, 430/430 cooldown requests, 11/11 regression checks.

### 16-fix-double-tls-id-leak.patch

**Status:** HIGH - the bridge's memory grows for as long as it runs
**Upstream Status:** Local fork (upstream Sigul is unmaintained; see below)
**Affects:** Bridge chiefly; the server and client share the module

**Problem:**
The soak harness found the bridge's memory growing steadily with
use (#32). Measured one request type at a time, it grew by the same
~5.2 kB per request for `list-users`, a 1 MB signature and a 64 MB
one alike, so the cost was per connection rather than per byte. A
`tracemalloc` diff across 300 requests put all of it in per-request
code, and a referrer walk of the live daemon found that request's
objects - both outer buffers, both inner bridging buffers, the
sockets - still reachable from one module-level dict.

That dict is `double_tls.__ids`. The module's debug helper `_id()`
gives each object a short label for debug output, and remembers the
label by keeping the object as a key, forever. Its only callers are
arguments to `_debug()`, which is a no-op, but Python evaluates
arguments whether or not the call does anything, so every request
labelled its buffers and sockets and the table pinned them, and with
them everything they refer to. The descriptors themselves were closed,
so nothing but memory showed it.

**Fix:**
`_id()` derives the label from `id()` and stores nothing. A label
stays stable for as long as its object lives, which is all debug
output needs.

This is the first of two leaks behind the growth. The second is in
`python-nss-ng`, not in Sigul: every `NSPRError` raised from C was
kept alive by a missing reference release, together with its
traceback, every frame on it and their locals. The non-blocking
handshakes raise `PR_WOULD_BLOCK_ERROR` as ordinary control flow,
several times per request. Fixing this patch alone left ~1 kB per
request, and fixing both leaves the bridge flat. The binding is fixed
at source, not patched here.

**Test:** `test/test_bridge_memory.py` labels 1000 objects the way the
bridge labels its buffers: without the patch all 1000 stay alive, with
it none do. Against the Compose stack, bridge memory over 300 requests
went from +5.2 kB per request to +0.3 kB with this patch, and to +0.0
with both fixes. The `tracemalloc` delta over 300 signing requests
fell from 1.46 MB to 2.4 kB.

## Applying Patches

The Docker build process automatically applies these patches:

1. `Dockerfile.{client,bridge,server}` copies this directory to `/tmp/patches/`
2. `build-scripts/install-sigul.sh` clones Sigul v1.4 from upstream (Pagure)
3. The script applies all `*.patch` files in alphanumeric order
4. Sigul is then built and installed with the fixes included

## Upstream status

At the time of writing, upstream Sigul on
[`pagure.io/sigul`](https://pagure.io/sigul) is effectively
unmaintained:

- The most recent commit is the v1.4 release tag, dated roughly a
  year ago.
- Open issues and pull requests have been sitting untouched.
- Pagure itself is scheduled to be decommissioned around mid-2026
  (Flock 2026); Fedora-hosted projects are being asked to migrate
  to `forge.fedoraproject.org`.

In practice this means the patches in this directory are a
**permanent local fork**, not a staging area for upstream
submission.  We carry them indefinitely, and any new fix should be
added here rather than waiting on an upstream release.  When
Pagure goes away we will need to re-host the v1.4 source tarball
that `build-scripts/install-sigul.sh` clones; the patch series itself
is self-contained and will continue to apply against any preserved
copy of v1.4.

## Adding a patch

1. **Keep the patch minimal** — one logical change per file; fix the
   bug, do not refactor surrounding code.
2. **Use the `NN-short-description.patch` filename convention** so
   patches apply in a stable order under
   `build-scripts/install-sigul.sh`.
3. **Include an explanatory header in the patch file itself** that
   describes the bug being fixed and why the chosen fix is the
   right shape; the existing patches use a `# SPDX…` block plus a
   prose explanation above the `diff --git` lines.
4. **Add a corresponding entry to this README** under `## Patches`,
   following the `Status / Affects / Problem / Fix / Impact`
   structure.  Mark the entry CRITICAL if the stack will not start
   without it.
5. **Verify the whole series still applies cleanly:** with the
   bundled Sigul v1.4 source available locally,

   ```bash
   cd .build-context/sigul
   for p in ../../patches/*.patch; do
       git apply --check "$p" || { echo "$p failed"; break; }
   done
   ```

   should print no errors.

## Verifying a single patch in isolation

```bash
# Local copy of upstream v1.4 (or any preserved mirror once Pagure
# is decommissioned)
cd /tmp
git clone --depth 1 --branch v1.4 https://pagure.io/sigul.git
cd sigul
patch -p1 < /path/to/sigul-docker/patches/01-fix-double-tls-handshake-timing.patch
echo $?  # Should be 0
```
